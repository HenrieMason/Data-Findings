<p>Below is a boxplot for accidents by weekday. Keep in mind that weekday 1 is Monday, while 7 is Sunday. It appears that Friday has the highest Median for incident count. Sunday appears to have the lowest accident count followed by Saturday. I find this highly unusual. Why does Saturday have a lower median accident rate than any other weekday?</p>
<p>I chose this graph because we decided to do it in class.</p>

<p>Though I already used a box plot for my previous graph, a box plot is highly sufficient for showing trends among time. Why is it that 2020 had a dramatic drop in accident count compared to 2019? Was it because of Covid, or because of the data’s lack of integrity? I would’ve assumed that the accident rate of today would be the same or greater as 2019.</p>
